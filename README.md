# AI-Based Vulnerability Analysis and Payload Generation Tool
## Overview
This project is an LLM-powered vulnerability assessment tool designed to analyze potentially vulnerable source code. Built using Ollama and Open WebUIâ€™s RAG, it performs analysis using best practices and can also generate payloads for testing potential vulnerabilities. Its primary purpose is to allow offline processing of confidential source code, ensuring local vulnerability analysis.

## Setup
- Clone this repository
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/DeeDash/vuln-analysis.git
  cd vuln-analysis
  ```
- **Prepare your RAG data:** Place documents in `rag-data/` folder. If left empty, the image will still ship with built-in security knowledge base.
- Build and start the containers
  ```
  docker compose up -d --build
  ```
- **Access the app:** Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
