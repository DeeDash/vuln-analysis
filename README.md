# Project Title: AI-Based Vulnerability Analysis and Payload Generation Tool
## Overview
This project is an AI/ML-powered vulnerability assessment tool designed to simulate real-world attack payloads and test applications against known security flaws. It leverages machine learning models trained on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and best-in-class defense strategies. The tool includes a payload generator built on top of the Ollama framework and uses a hybrid approach combining signature heuristics with AI inference for realistic attack simulation.

## Key Features
- AI/ML models trained on OWASP Top 10, secure coding standards, and real-world exploit data  
- Automated payload generation for testing input validation, authentication flaws, injection vectors, and more  
- Integration with Ollama for high-performance model deployment  
- Signature-based and heuristic-enhanced detection and attack emulation  
- Modular architecture for extending new payload types or analysis strategies  
- CLI and API interfaces for integration into CI/CD pipelines or security scanners  

## Technology Stack
- **Ollama**: LLM-based payload generation and inference  
- **Python**: Core engine and API  
- **JSON/YAML**: Config-driven payload templates  
- **Heuristic modules**: Regex, token-based, pattern matching
